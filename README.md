Certainly! Let’s go through the steps to create and initialize a Git repository for the **Goal Configuration Module**. Here’s how to get started:

### Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub (or GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.)

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) (or your preferred Git hosting provider).
2. Click on **New Repository**.
3. Enter a **Repository Name** (e.g., `goal-configuration-app`).
4. Choose **Public** or **Private** as needed.
5. (Optional) Add a **README.md** to initialize the repository.
6. Click **Create Repository**.

Once the repository is created, you’ll be given a URL to clone it locally. For example:
```plaintext
https://github.com/your-username/goal-configuration-app.git
```

### Step 2: Clone the Repository Locally

Open a terminal or command prompt and run:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/goal-configuration-app.git
cd goal-configuration-app
```

### Step 3: Set Up the Project Structure

Assuming we are using **React** for the frontend, you can initialize a React project within the repository:

1. Run the following commands to initialize the project using **Create React App**:
   ```sh
   npx create-react-app goal-configuration-app
   cd goal-configuration-app
   ```

2. **Add Necessary Dependencies**:
   Install **Material-UI** (or another UI library) to start building the configuration UI:
   ```sh
   npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
   ```

### Step 4: Create an Initial Commit

1. Check the status to see newly created files:
   ```sh
   git status
   ```

2. Add all files:
   ```sh
   git add .
   ```

3. Commit the initial setup:
   ```sh
   git commit -m "Initial setup of React project with Material-UI"
   ```

4. Push to GitHub:
   ```sh
   git push origin main
   ```

### Step 5: Set Up Branches for Feature Development

To keep the work organized, create separate branches for each major part of the configuration module. This will make development cleaner and easier to review.

1. **Create Branches**:
   - For Goal Hierarchy Selection Panel:
     ```sh
     git checkout -b feature/goal-hierarchy-selection
     ```
   - For Breakdown and Scheduling Options:
     ```sh
     git checkout -b feature/breakdown-scheduling-options
     ```
   - For Custom Field and Evaluation Setup:
     ```sh
     git checkout -b feature/custom-field-evaluation
     ```
   - For Preview and Save Configuration:
     ```sh
     git checkout -b feature/preview-save-configuration
     ```

2. **Push Branches to GitHub** (if desired):
   ```sh
   git push origin feature/goal-hierarchy-selection
   ```

Now you’re set up to start developing each part of the configuration module! Let me know if you’d like assistance with implementing specific components on any branch.
